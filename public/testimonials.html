      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>"I am an international PhD student and found it difficult to understand some concepts and theories. Thomas made my life easier as he explained to me every thing in detail with incredible understanding. I really enjoy the way he teaches and his kindness. In some session we only could communicate via email but even then I had no difficulties understanding Thomas' explanations, it was almost as if I was sitting in front of him."
      <br>&mdash; Huda</p>
			<p>"We have been very fortunate to have known Thomas for a number of years now and he has tutored two of our children in both physics and maths during this time. Thomas has been exceptional with them and I cannot recommend him highly enough. He is enthusiastic, thorough in his teaching, engaging and able to communicate with and inspire young people. Thomas encouraged our children to be creative in their thinking, to question and challenge themselves, and to aspire to reach their full potential."
			<br>&mdash; Vivien</p>
      <p>"After practising German with Thomas I was able to travel alone through Germany without relying on phrase books or translators. A lot of people think everyone in Germany speaks English, but it isn't true. I would have made a lot of errors if it wasn't for all of the cultural tips Thomas included in his lessons."
      <br>&mdash; Catherine</p>
