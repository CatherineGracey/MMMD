      <h3>Tutoring</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Dr Thomas Biershenk, and I love maths and science. I have a PhD in physics and I am a native German speaker, so I can offer tutoring in the following subjects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <ul>
          <li>primary school</li>
          <li>secondary school</li>
          <li>undergraduate</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Science</li>
        <ul>
          <li>primary school</li>
          <li>secondary school</li>
          <li>undergraduate</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Physics</li>
        <ul>
          <li>secondary school</li>
          <li>undergraduate</li>
          <li>postgraduate</li>

        <li>German</li>
        <ul>
          <li>conversational skills</li>
          <li>maths and science vocabulary</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>For all subjects I offer a home tutoring service for the Frankston, Dandenong and Cranbourne areas, and online tutoring sessions using Skype. Tutoring sessions are possible as the traditional one-on-one or in small groups with up to 5 students if you and your friends want to work through certain problems together.</p>
      <p>My tutoring services include, but are not limited to, homework support, exam preparation, general understanding, and experiments.</p>

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <h4>How long have you been tutoring for?</h4>
      <p>I have tutored for eight years: four years in Germany and four years in Australia.</p>
      <h4>What are your qualifications and experience?</h4>
      <p>Maths & Physics: I hold a Diplom Physiker from Friedrich-Schiller-Universit√§t Jena in Germany and a PhD in physics from the Australian National University. My PhD was on the effects of swift heavy ion irradiation of amorphous germanium, amorphous silicon and amorphous silicon-germanium alloys. Please review my <a href="#publications">publications</a> if you would like to know more about my work.</p>
      <p>German: I am a native German speaker, and have spent the past three years tutoring for conversational German.</p>
      <h4>Do you belong to a relevant industry association?</h4>
      <p>I have applied for accreditation with the Australian Tutoring Association.</p>
      <h4>Can you give me the contact details of anyone who has used your service before?</h4>
      <p>Yes, although for privacy reasons this is upon request only.</p>
      <h4>Do you hold a Working With Children check?</h4>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <h4>Where do you tutor?</h4>
      <p>I am based in Melbourne, Australia, and I tutor locally in the Frankston, Cranbourne and Dandenong areas. I can come to your home or we can meet at a convenient venue such as the library or a coffee shop. I am also happy to tutor outside these areas via Skype.</p>
      <h4>Am I required to sign a contract?</h4>
      <p>No.</p>
      <h4>How long will I or my child need tutoring for?</h4>
      <p>You are the best judge of that. Some people will only need a single session of tutoring, while others might need help twice a week for the entire school year. How quickly you progress will depend on how much effort you put into learning and how focused your study sessions are. Tutoring can help with that, but it is not the only method.</p>
      <h4>Do you have a refund policy?</h4>
      <p>If you are not completely satisfied with your tutoring session then I will gladly refund the full cost of one session. If you have paid for a tutoring bundle I will also refund any remaining lessons at the full rate. I will not refund multiple past lessons because I want you to tell me as soon as you are unsatisfied, not weeks later!</p>
      <h4>What happens if I need to cancel a tutoring session?</h4>
      <p>If you are able to notify me five hours before a session then I am happy to cancel or reschedule at no extra charge. Cancellations after this time will incur a 50% cancellation fee. If you cancel when I am already at the tutoring location it will incur the full fee.</p>
      <h4>Am I required to buy anything extra?</h4>
      <p>You will only be required to buy anything extra if you would like to conduct experiments that require particular consumables. I might suggest an experiment if I think it will help you to grasp an otherwise abstract concept, but you are under no obligation to accept the suggestion.</p>
      <h4>What is your preferred method of payment?</h4>
      <p>I can accept cash and EFT payments.</p>
      <h4>Will I be provided with a receipt?</h4>
      <p>Yes. (Unless you don't want one, in which case I am happy to save paper.)</p>
