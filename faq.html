      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <h4>Where do you tutor?</h4>
      <p>I am based in Melbourne, Australia, and I tutor locally in the Frankston, Cranbourne, Dandenong and surrounding areas. I can come to your home or we can meet at a convenient venue such as the library or a coffee shop. I am also happy to tutor via Skype.</p>
      
      <h4>I live outside this area and would like you to tutor me. What can I do?</h4>
      <p>While I wont be able to travel to your home, I offer online tutoring as well. It doesn't matter if you live in Dallas or Dubbo, all you need is a Skype account.</p>
      
      <h4>How long have you been tutoring for?</h4>
      <p>I have tutored science for eight years: four years in Germany and four years in Australia. I have tutored German for three years in Australia.</p>
      
      <h4>What are your qualifications and experience?</h4>
      <p>Maths, Science & Physics: I hold a Physik Diplom from the Friedrich-Schiller-Universit√§t Jena in Germany and a PhD in physics from the Australian National University. My PhD was on the effects of swift heavy ion irradiation on amorphous germanium, amorphous silicon and amorphous silicon-germanium alloys. Please check out my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> if you would like to know more about my research.</p>
      <p>German: I am a native German speaker, and have spent the past three years tutoring for conversational German.</p>
      
      <h4>Do you hold a Working With Children check?</h4>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      
      <h4>Can you give me the contact details of anyone who has used your service before?</h4>
      <p>Yes, although for privacy reasons this is upon request only.</p>
      
      <h4>Am I required to sign a contract?</h4>
      <p>No.</p>
      
      <h4>How long will I or my child need tutoring for?</h4>
      <p>You are the best judge of that. Some people will only need one tutoring session, while others might need help twice a week for the entire school year. How quickly you progress will depend on how much effort you put into learning and how focused your study sessions are. Tutoring can help with that, but it is not the only method.</p>
      
      <h4>Do you just help with homework or do you also provide study material?</h4>
      <p>This depends completely on your needs. If you need someone to help you with your homework then I can do that. If you want to practise for an exam with real questions and problems, that can be arranged. We can work through problems in your textbooks or you can ask me to put together some questions. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have an unusual tutoring request.</p>
      
      <h4>Am I required to buy anything extra?</h4>
      <p>Generally, you are not required to buy anything extra. However, if you would like to run an experiment, additional costs may arise for consumables that are required to conduct the experiment.</p>
      
      <h4>My child really needs help to improve their grades but doesn't want a private tutor. Can you help?</h4>
      <p>I would love to help your children with whatever problems they have with maths, science or German. However, please bear in mind that the outcome of private tutoring sessions might not be what you hope for if your child is not willing to do additional studies. A good starting point might be to read through the links on the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page.</p>
      
      <h4>Do you have a refund policy?</h4>
      <p>If you are not completely satisfied with the quality of your tutoring session then I will gladly refund the full cost of the session. I will not refund multiple past lessons because I want you to tell me as soon as you are unsatisfied, not weeks later!</p>
      
      <h4>Why are Skype tutoring sessions cheaper than tutoring in person?</h4>
      <p>Tutoring over Skype is cheaper for me because I do not have to pay for petrol or spend time travelling. I decided to pass these savings on to you, but if you would prefer to pay the full rate I am happy to oblige.</p>
      
      <h4>What happens if I need to cancel a tutoring session?</h4>
      <p>If you are able to notify me five hours before a session then I am happy to cancel or reschedule at no extra charge. Cancellations after this time will incur a 50% cancellation fee. If you don't cancel before our session is due to start it will incur the full fee.</p>
      
      <h4>What is your preferred method of payment?</h4>
      <p>I can accept cash and EFT payments.</p>
      
      <h4>Will I be provided with a receipt?</h4>
      <p>Yes. (Unless you don't want one, in which case I am happy to save paper.)</p>
